**Dear student group of AMI 2023,**

this is your GitLab repository. Please follow the guidelines we gave you in the session at 25th of may:

 - Keep your repository clean and structured
 - The branch relevant for submission is `main` (formely called `master`)
 - Replace this readme file with the respective information concerning your project
 - GitLab is not just about code, but also about project organization. Leverage its power through Issues, Branches, Boards, Wiki, ...
 - A reasonable amount of visible contribution for each group member is required. GitLab offers many ways to do so!


**What about these folders?**

We initialized your repository with two folders. The `app` folder is where you will implement your containerized web application once you made plans how and what you want to achieve. The `deploy` folder is where configuration will be done to deploy your application on kubernetes. We will discuss these topics in a dedicated session.

For code that is about data exploration etc. just create folders beside the existing ones.

**What about the group share?**

We placed the access information in your [project's wiki](/../../wikis/home/Group-Share-Access).

&nbsp;

Best regards and have fun!

*AMI-Team*
